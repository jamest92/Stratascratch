We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. 
Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. 
Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and current salary. 
Order your list by employee ID in ascending order


DataFrame: ms_employee_salary
Expected Output Type: pandas.DataFrame

ms_employee_salary
id            int64
first_name    object
last_name     object
salary        int64
department_id int64

sample:
id	first_name	last_name	salary	department_id
1	Todd	Wilson	110000	1006
1	Todd	Wilson	106119	1006
2	Justin	Simon	128922	1005
2	Justin	Simon	130000	1005
3	Kelly	Rosario	42689	1002


Solution:
import pandas as pd

ms_employee_salary.groupby('id').max().reset_index()
